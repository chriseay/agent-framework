# [Project Name] Roadmap

<!-- Milestones are optional. If used, group related phases under a milestone heading with a goal and success criteria. If not used, list phases at the top level. -->

## Milestone 1: [Name] (optional)

<!-- Goal: [What this milestone delivers when all its phases are complete] -->
<!-- Success Criteria: [How to know the milestone is done] -->

### Phase 0: [Name]

- [Deliverable or task]
- [Deliverable or task]
- Verification: [How to verify this phase is complete]
- Status: Not started

### Phase 1: [Name]

- [Deliverable or task]
- [Deliverable or task]
- Verification: [How to verify this phase is complete]
- Status: Not started

### Phase 2: [Name]

- [Deliverable or task]
- [Deliverable or task]
- Verification: [How to verify this phase is complete]
- Status: Not started

<!-- Add more phases as needed. Each phase should be small enough to complete in one focused session. -->

## Deferred Phases

<!-- Deferred work that needs its own /discuss → /close-out cycle. Promote to a numbered phase during /discuss when ready. -->

<!-- Example:
- **API rate limiting**: Implement request throttling. Deferred from Phase 2 — not urgent until public launch.
-->

## Deferred Verifications

<!-- Verifications postponed from earlier phases. Check off during /discuss when satisfied; convert to a deferred phase if dedicated work is needed. -->

<!-- Example:
- **Load test under concurrency**: Verify the API handles 100 concurrent users. Deferred from Phase 3 — needs staging environment.
