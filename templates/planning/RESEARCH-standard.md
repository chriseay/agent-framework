# Phase [XX] Research (Standard)

## Scope Reminder

[1–2 sentences on what this phase covers.]

## Codebase Review

[Affected files, integration points, and current state. Note how existing code connects to the planned work.]

## Data Flow / State Implications

[How data moves through the system for this feature. State management approach, persistence implications, side effects.]

## Online Research

[Constraints, platform behaviour, or tooling findings from online search. Note anything that affects feasibility or approach.]

## Risks / Unknowns To Carry Into Planning

[Issues the plan must address. Be specific — "OCR may be slow on large images" not just "performance risk."]

## Suggested Solutions / Adjustments
