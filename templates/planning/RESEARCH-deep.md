# Phase [XX] Research (Deep)

## Scope Reminder

[1–2 sentences on what this phase covers.]

## Codebase Review

[Full review including indirect dependencies. Document all files that will be affected or need awareness, even if not directly modified.]

## Data Flow / State Implications

[Detailed analysis of how data moves through the system. Migration paths, schema changes, state transitions, side effects on existing features.]

## Online Research

[Thorough coverage of constraints, platform behaviour, and tooling limits. Include specific findings, not just summaries.]

## Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| [Risk description] | [Low/Medium/High] | [Low/Medium/High] | [Proposed mitigation] |

## Suggested Solutions / Adjustments

[Proposed approaches based on findings. If multiple options exist, list trade-offs. Recommend a preferred approach with rationale.]

## Feasibility Assessment

[Prototype recommendations, feasibility checks, or proof-of-concept steps to validate before committing to full implementation. Use "Not required" if the approach is well-understood.]
